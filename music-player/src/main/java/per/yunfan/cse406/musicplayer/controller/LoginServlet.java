    /**
     * Called by the server (via the <code>service</code> method)
     * to allow a servlet to handle a POST request.
     * <p>
     * The HTTP POST method allows the client to send
     * data of unlimited length to the Web server a single time
     * and is useful when posting information such as
     * credit card numbers.
     *
     * <p>When overriding this method, read the request data,
     * write the response headers, get the response's writer or output
     * stream object, and finally, write the response data. It's best
     * to include content type and encoding. When using a
     * <code>PrintWriter</code> object to return the response, set the
     * content type before accessing the <code>PrintWriter</code> object.
     *
     * <p>The servlet container must write the headers before committing the
     * response, because in HTTP the headers must be sent before the
     * response body.
     *
     * <p>Where possible, set the Content-Length header (with the
     * {@link ServletResponse#setContentLength} method),
     * to allow the servlet container to use a persistent connection
     * to return its response to the client, improving performance.
     * The content length is automatically set if the entire response fits
     * inside the response buffer.
     *
     * <p>When using HTTP 1.1 chunked encoding (which means that the response
     * has a Transfer-Encoding header), do not set the Content-Length header.
     *
     * <p>This method does not need to be either safe or idempotent.
     * Operations requested through POST can have side effects for
     * which the user can be held accountable, for example,
     * updating stored data or buying items online.
     *
     * <p>If the HTTP POST request is incorrectly formatted,
     * <code>doPost</code> returns an HTTP "Bad Request" message.
     *
     * @param req  an {@link HttpServletRequest} object that
     *             contains the request the client has made
     *             of the servlet
     * @param resp an {@link HttpServletResponse} object that
     *             contains the response the servlet sends
